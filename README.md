# Terraform

This repository is for my task given in HybridMulticloud summer training from Linux world under the mentorship of 
<h3>Vimal Daga </h3>
<br>
In this task We will create a EKS cluster using 
Terraform.This will enable us to create and destroy the cluster just in one click. 
<h2>EKS</h2>
Amazon EKS (Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes) is a managed Kubernetes service that allows you to run Kubernetes on AWS without the hassle of managing the Kubernetes control plane.<br>

The Kubernetes control plane plays a crucial role in a Kubernetes deployment as it is responsible for how Kubernetes communicates with your cluster â€” starting and stopping new containers, scheduling containers, performing health checks, and many more management tasks.<br>

The big benefit of EKS, and other similar hosted Kubernetes services, is taking away the operational burden involved in running this control plane. You deploy cluster worker nodes using defined AMIs and with the help of CloudFormation, and EKS will provision, scale and manage the Kubernetes control plane for you to ensure high availability, security and scalability.<br>
<br>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<br>
Make sure you have the following  configured 
<br>
<ul>
    <li>AWS CLI</li>
    <li>AWS cli configure with the account with IAM role permission</li>
    <li>IAM authenticator</li>
    <li>kubectl</li>
    <li>eksctl</li>
</ul>


























<br>
For launching the cluster clone this repostory and run the following .


```terraform apply eks.tf ```
